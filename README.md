# Achievo

### Purpose:
These days even "simple" ToDo applications are no longer simple. They're far too overengineered and 
sometimes a headache to keep up with. Achievo is my own attempt at the classic ToDo List project,
and I made it with simplicity at the forefront. The main user interface is made with CustomTkinter[^1] and with a basic class heirarchy. Using Matplotlib[^2], there is even a simple data visualization feature to display progress on goal completion.
